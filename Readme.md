# Learning About Linux

## Introduction
This document contains key learnings about Linux, including its history, distributions, and basic commands. Linux is an open-source operating system widely used for servers, development, and as a platform for various software applications. By learning Linux, you can enhance your technical skills and gain better control over system operations.

## Section 1: Linux History

Linux originated in 1991 when Linus Torvalds, a Finnish software engineer, created the Linux kernel. The kernel is the core of the Linux operating system, which interacts with hardware and manages resources. Linux was developed as a free and open-source alternative to proprietary operating systems like Unix. 

Since its creation, Linux has evolved into one of the most widely used operating systems, especially in server environments, cloud infrastructure, and embedded systems. The collaborative nature of open-source development has allowed the Linux ecosystem to thrive, with thousands of contributors and organizations helping shape its development. Today, Linux powers a significant portion of the internet and is integral to modern computing technologies like cloud computing, containers, and DevOps practices.
